The task
1. Program a car. The car should have the following functionalities: Engine on, Engine
off, Accelerate, Decelerate, Turn left, and Turn right.
2. The program should accept the following inputs: Input for engine on/off, Input for
throttling, Input for breaking, Input for turning left, and Input for turning right.
The inputs can be real user inputs or hard coded events (i.e. you may simulate a key
press in your code, just document it well).
3. The program should print the following outputs: Current velocity in km/h (default: 0
km/h), and Direction in degrees (0°-359°, default: 0°).
The outputs should be updated constantly at a rate of your choosing, e.g. once per
second.
4. The functionality of the car should be logical (the car can’t accelerate with the engine
turned off, the car can’t turn at zero velocity, and so on). Throttling and braking
should affect the velocity and turning should affect the direction.
Methods
You may use any programming or scripting language (Python, Javascript, C#, Lua...) for
completing this task. If you are not comfortable with any programming language, you can
even write pseudo code, as long as you document it well.
Evaluation
Your design, structure, clarity of implementation and documentation (comments, design
documents etc.) will be evaluated.
Return your submission as a zip file ​or​ as a link to a cloud service of your choosing (e.g.
Github, Pastebin…) containing all your files.
