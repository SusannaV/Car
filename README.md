# The Car Program

This program creates a car and let's you drive around the screen with it. Flowchart of the design can be found in the folder (Design flowchart.pdf).

### How does it work?
- Upon opening the program shows you a car, speedometer, direction, engine status and two buttons for starting and shutting off the engine.
- The only input the program now accepts is powering on the engine. After engine is on, it is now possible to accelerate the car by pressing the up arrow on your keyboad.
- The car is by default going straight up, to direction 0 degrees. Velocity and direction update immediately.
- The car will use engine braking to gradually slow down, if you don't accelerate.
- While the car is in motion, you can now steer the car by pressing left or right arrows or slow the car down by pressing down arrow on your keyboard.
- The car has a maximum speed limit and is not able to reverse.
- In case the engine is turned of while the car is still in motion, engine keeps slowly braking and you are able to steer and brake yourself. Acceleration is not allowed when the engine is turned off.
